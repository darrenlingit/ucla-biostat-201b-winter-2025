**Question:**

A researcher is studying the association between a new drug and disease remission across two different hospitals. The data collected is summarized in the following stratified contingency tables:

|         |               |               |       |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------|
|         | Remission (+) | Remission (-) | Total |
| Drug    | 40            | 20            | 60    |
| Placebo | 30            | 30            | 60    |

|         |               |               |       |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------|
|         | Remission (+) | Remission (-) | Total |
| Drug    | 50            | 30            | 80    |
| Placebo | 20            | 40            | 60    |


**Solution:**

To calculate the **Mantel-Haenszel Common Odds Ratio (MH OR)**, we use the formula:

$$
OR_{MH} = \frac{\sum \frac{a_i d_i}{n_i}}{\sum \frac{b_i c_i}{n_i}}
$$

where for each stratum $i$:

- $a_i$ = number of exposed cases (Drug & Remission +)
- $b_i$ = number of exposed non-cases (Drug & Remission -)
- $c_i$ = number of unexposed cases (Placebo & Remission +)
- $d_i$ = number of unexposed non-cases (Placebo & Remission -)
- $n_i$ = total number of observations in the stratum

### Step 1: Extract Data from Each Hospital

For **Hospital 1:**

$$
a_1 = 40, \quad b_1 = 20, \quad c_1 = 30, \quad d_1 = 30, \quad n_1 = 120
$$

For **Hospital 2:**

$$
a_2 = 50, \quad b_2 = 30, \quad c_2 = 20, \quad d_2 = 40, \quad n_2 = 140
$$

### Step 2: Compute the Mantel-Haenszel Components

$$
\sum \frac{a_i d_i}{n_i} = \frac{(40 \times 30)}{120} + \frac{(50 \times 40)}{140}
$$

$$
= \frac{1200}{120} + \frac{2000}{140}
$$

$$
= 10 + 14.29 = 24.29
$$

$$
\sum \frac{b_i c_i}{n_i} = \frac{(20 \times 30)}{120} + \frac{(30 \times 20)}{140}
$$

$$
= \frac{600}{120} + \frac{600}{140}
$$

$$
= 5 + 4.29 = 9.29
$$

### Step 3: Compute the Mantel-Haenszel Common Odds Ratio

$$
OR_{MH} = \frac{24.29}{9.29} = 2.61
$$

### Step 4: Interpretation

Since the **Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratio** is **2.61**, this suggests that across both hospitals, patients receiving the drug have **2.61 times higher odds** of experiencing remission compared to those receiving the placebo. This indicates a **strong positive association** between the drug and disease remission.
