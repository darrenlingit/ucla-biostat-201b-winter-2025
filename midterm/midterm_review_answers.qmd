## Problem 2

**Question:**

A researcher is studying the association between a new drug and disease remission across two different hospitals. The data collected is summarized in the following stratified contingency tables:

|         |               |               |       |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------|
|         | Remission (+) | Remission (-) | Total |
| Drug    | 40            | 20            | 60    |
| Placebo | 30            | 30            | 60    |

|         |               |               |       |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------|
|         | Remission (+) | Remission (-) | Total |
| Drug    | 50            | 30            | 80    |
| Placebo | 20            | 40            | 60    |


**Solution:**

To calculate the **Mantel-Haenszel Common Odds Ratio (MH OR)**, we use the formula:

$$
OR_{MH} = \frac{\sum \frac{a_i d_i}{n_i}}{\sum \frac{b_i c_i}{n_i}}
$$

where for each stratum $i$:

- $a_i$ = number of exposed cases (Drug & Remission +)
- $b_i$ = number of exposed non-cases (Drug & Remission -)
- $c_i$ = number of unexposed cases (Placebo & Remission +)
- $d_i$ = number of unexposed non-cases (Placebo & Remission -)
- $n_i$ = total number of observations in the stratum

### Step 1: Extract Data from Each Hospital

For **Hospital 1:**

$$
a_1 = 40, \quad b_1 = 20, \quad c_1 = 30, \quad d_1 = 30, \quad n_1 = 120
$$

For **Hospital 2:**

$$
a_2 = 50, \quad b_2 = 30, \quad c_2 = 20, \quad d_2 = 40, \quad n_2 = 140
$$

### Step 2: Compute the Mantel-Haenszel Components

$$
\sum \frac{a_i d_i}{n_i} = \frac{(40 \times 30)}{120} + \frac{(50 \times 40)}{140}
$$

$$
= \frac{1200}{120} + \frac{2000}{140}
$$

$$
= 10 + 14.29 = 24.29
$$

$$
\sum \frac{b_i c_i}{n_i} = \frac{(20 \times 30)}{120} + \frac{(30 \times 20)}{140}
$$

$$
= \frac{600}{120} + \frac{600}{140}
$$

$$
= 5 + 4.29 = 9.29
$$

### Step 3: Compute the Mantel-Haenszel Common Odds Ratio

$$
OR_{MH} = \frac{24.29}{9.29} = 2.61
$$

### Step 4: Interpretation

Since the **Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratio** is **2.61**, this suggests that across both hospitals, patients receiving the drug have **2.61 times higher odds** of experiencing remission compared to those receiving the placebo. This indicates a **strong positive association** between the drug and disease remission.

## Problem 3

A researcher is conducting a cohort study to investigate the effect of smoking on lung cancer incidence. The study follows two groups of individuals: Smokers and Non-Smokers. However, since age is a confounding variable, the researcher stratifies the participants into two age groups: Young (≤ 50 years) and Old (\> 50 years).

| Age Group    | Smokers (Cases / Total) | Non-Smokers (Cases / Total) |
|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Young (≤ 50) | 50 / 5,000              | 20 / 6,000                  |
| Old (\> 50)  | 200 / 3,000             | 100 / 4,000                 |

Additionally, the researcher uses a standard population with the following age distribution:

-   **Young (≤ 50 years):** 7,000 individuals
-   **Old (\> 50 years):** 5,000 individuals

### Part (A) 

Compute the age-stratified risk of lung cancer in both smokers and non-smokers.

**Solution:** The risk of lung cancer in each stratum is given by:

For Smokers:

-   Young (≤ 50 years): $$\hat{p}_{smoker, young} = \frac{50}{500}$$

-   Old (\> 50 years): $$\hat{p}_{smoker, old} = \frac{200}{3000} = 0.0667$$ 

For Non-Smokers:

- Young (≤ 50 years): 
$$\hat{p}_{nonsmoker, young} = \frac{20}{6000} = 0.0033$$ 

- Old (\> 50 years): 
$$\hat{p}_{nonsmoker, old} = \frac{100}{4000} = 0.025$$ 

### Part (B)

Perform direct standardization to calculate the adjusted risk for both smokers and non-smokers using the standard population.

**Solution:**  We first define the standard reference distribution:
$$t_{young} = 7000, \;\; t_{old} = 5000$$
For Smokers:
$$ \hat{p}_{smoker} = \frac{t_{young}\cdot \hat{p}_{young, smoker} + t_{old}\cdot \hat{p}_{old, smoker}}{t_{young} + t_{old}} = 0.0336 $$


For Non-Smokers:

$$\hat{p}_{nonsmoker} = \frac{t_{young}\cdot \hat{p}_{young, nonsmoker} + t_{old}\cdot \hat{p}_{old, nonsmoker}}{t_{young} + t_{old}} = 0.0123$$

### Part (C)

Compute the adjusted risk difference (RD) and the adjusted risk ratio (RR) between smokers and non-smokers.

**Solution:** 

Risk Difference is defined as $$\hat{RD} = \hat{p}_{smoker} - \hat{p}_{nonsmoker} = 0.0213.$$

The Risk Ratio is defined as $$\hat{RR} = \frac{\hat{p}_{smoker}}{\hat{p}_{nonsmoker}} = 2.73.$$


### Part (D)

Does smoking increase the risk of lung cancer after adjusting for age?

**Solution:** 

Smokers are 2.73 times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers, even after adjusting for age.

The risk difference of 21.3 per 1,000 suggests that if smoking were eliminated, about 21.3 cases per 1,000 individuals could potentially be prevented in a similar population.
