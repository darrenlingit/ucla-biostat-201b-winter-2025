#### Problem 1

A researcher wants to determine if there is an association between smoking status and the presence of lung disease. The following table summarizes the data collected from a sample of 200 participants:

| Smoking Status | Lung Disease (Yes) | Lung Disease (No) | Total |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Smoker         | 50                 | 30                | 80    |
| Non Smoker     | 20                 | 100               | 120   |
| **Total**      | 70                 | 130               | 200   |

**a.** If we want to determine if there is a significant association between smoking status and the presence of lung disease, what test should be used?

| **Solution:** Chi-Square Test of Independence.

**b.** Carry out the test at $\alpha = 0.05$. Report the test-statistic and interpret the results.

| **Solution:**
| $H_0$:  There is not an association between smoking status and the presence of lung disease.
| $H_1$: There is an association between smoking status and the presence of lung disease.
| 
| First, we calculate the expected table:

| Smoking Status | Lung Disease (Yes) | Lung Disease (No) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Smoker | $E_{11}  = \frac{80\cdot 70}{200}=28$ | $E_{12}  = \frac{80\cdot 130}{200}=52$ |
| Non Smoker | $E_{21}  = \frac{70\cdot 120}{200}=42$ | $E_{22}  = \frac{120\cdot 130}{200}=78$ |

| Then the test statistic:
| $$
  X^2 = \sum_{ij} \frac{(O_{ij}-E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}} = 44.3223
  $$
| with degrees of freedom $(r-1)(c-1) = 1$.
| 
| Finally, the p-value becomes:
| $$
  p = P(X^2_{df=1} > 44.3223) \approx 0
  $$
| So we reject the $H_0$ and confidently conclude that their is an association between those with lung cancer and their smoking status.

**c.** Let $X$ represent the number of smokers who develop lung disease in the sample above. Now suppose we randomly select 5 individuals. Find the expected number and variance of smokers with lung disease from the 5 selected.

| **Solution:**
| Note that $X \sim (n=5, p = \frac{50}{80} = 0.625)$. 
| Then $E(X) = 5 \cdot 0.625 = 3.125$ and $Var(X) = 5 \cdot 0.625 (1-0.625) = 1.1718.$

**d.** Suppose the following summary statistics is obtained of smokers and non-smokers from the sample

| Smoking Status | Sample Mean Age | Standard Deviation of Age |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Smoker         | 40              | 10                        |
| Non Smoker     | 45              | 12                        |

Suppose the standard deviation obtained above is representative of their respective populations. Determine if there is a significant difference in mean ages between smokers and non-smokers.

(*Hint: the test statistics for a two-sample z-test is* $Z = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - (\mu_1  - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}$)

| **Solution:**
| Let $1$ = smokers and $2$ = non smokers.
| We perform a *two sample z-test*. 
| $H_0$: $\mu_1 = \mu_2$
| $H_1$: $\mu_1 \not= \mu_2$
| Then the test statistic:
| $$
  Z = \frac{(40-45)}{\sqrt{\frac{10^2}{80} + \frac{12^2}{120}}} = -3.19
  $$
| Finally, the p-value
| $$
  p = 2\cdot P(Z\leq-3.19) = 2â‹…0.00071 \approx 0.
  $$
| We reject the $H_0$ and conclude that their is difference between age of smokers and non-smokers.
| 

**e.** Calculate the relative risk (RR) and odds ratio (OR) for smokers developing lung disease compared to non-smokers.

| **Solution:**
| $$
  RR = \frac{50/80}{20/120} = 3.75
  $$
| $$
  OR = \frac{50\cdot 100}{30 \cdot 20} = 8.333
  $$
