**Question:**

A study seeks to examine whether gender is associated with being a smoker. The researchers survey a population in the current month. Out of 500 total individuals, they find that there are 200 smokers. Out of all the male participants, 150 were smokers, while 75 were not.

Find a point estimate and a 95% confidence interval for this point estimate comparing the difference in risk of smoking between male and females. What can we conclude from these results?

**Answer:**

|                 | Male | Female |     |
|-----------------|------|--------|-----|
| **Non-Smokers** | 75   | 225    | 300 |
| **Smokers**     | 150  | 50     | 200 |
|                 | 225  | 275    | 500 |

$$
\hat{RD}= \frac{150}{225} - \frac{50}{275} = 0.4848
$$

$$
\hat{RD} \pm z_{1-0.05/2}*\sqrt{\frac{ac}{n_1^3}+\frac{bd}{n_2^3}}
= 0.4848 \pm 1.96 * \sqrt{\frac{75*150}{225^3}+\frac{225*50}{275^3}}
= (0.408, 0.561)
$$

```{r}
# calculating in R
lwr <- (150/225 - 50/275) - (1.96 * sqrt((75*150)/(225^3)+(225*50)/(275^3)))
upr <- (150/225 - 50/275) + (1.96 * sqrt((75*150)/(225^3)+(225*50)/(275^3)))
```
